        <h2>Webb's Southern Ring Nebula</h2>
        <p> Cataloged as NGC 3132 the Southern Ring Nebula is a planetary nebula,
          the death shroud of a dying sun-like star some 2,500 light-years from
          Earth. Composed of gas and dust the stunning cosmic landscape is
          nearly half a light-year in diameter, explored in unprecedented detail
          by the James Webb Space Telescope. In this NIRCam image the bright
          star near center is a companion of the dying star. In mutual orbit,
          the star whose transformation has ejected the nebula's gas and dust
          shells over thousands of years is the fainter stellar partner.
          Evolving to become a white dwarf, the faint star appears along the
          diffraction spike extending toward the 8 o'clock position. This
          stellar pair's orbital motion has resulted the complex structures
          within the Southern Ring Nebula.</p>
